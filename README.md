As the player in this game you need to kill the enemy that is trying to 
Kill you. In the scene there are 2 spawners from where the enemy will 
appear. They are programmed to follow your position and attack when are 
near you. The prefabs of the game have shoot animations, death, idle 
and walk. The player has a health bar so when it dies is will play the animations
and the game will restart. I also added a kill counter to the game to see how 
many enemies you killed.
